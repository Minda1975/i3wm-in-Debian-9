# i3wm-in-Debian-9
i3wm configuration files for Debian 9. It is just my personal configuration files for comfortable usage of Debian 9. I use i3 wm as my wm. No DE or other window manager. 

i3 is a tiling window manager, completely written from scratch. The target platforms are GNU/Linux and BSD operating systems, our code is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) under the BSD license. i3 is primarily targeted at advanced users and developers. 

For aplication launcher i use Rofi with custom script. This amazing program (Rofi) is also used for lock, reboot and poweroff the system (separate script).

For pipe information to i3status, i use conky. Config files for conky is placed in this repo.

Also, in this repo you will find other usefull scripts (in folder .scripts) and tools (in folder .utility)


Keep a good computing ðŸ™‚
