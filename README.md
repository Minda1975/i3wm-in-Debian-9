# i3wm-in-Debian-9
i3wm configuration files for Debian 9. It is just my personal configuration files for comfortable usage of Debian 9. I use i3 wm as my wm. No DE or other window manager. 

i3 is a tiling window manager, completely written from scratch. The target platforms are GNU/Linux and BSD operating systems, our code is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) under the BSD license. i3 is primarily targeted at advanced users and developers.

With this configuration, I tried to replicate Manjaro Linux i3, which looks aesthetically pleasing, but it is not stable and usable as daily driver (just check bug with very long boot time). 

For aplication launcher i use dmenu with custom colors. Rofi is  used for lock, reboot and poweroff the system (separate script).

For pipe information to i3status, i use conky. Config files for conky is placed in this repo.

Also, in this repo you will find other usefull scripts (in folder .scripts), tools (in folder .utility), gtk3 themes, cursor theme and icon themes.


Keep a good computing ðŸ™‚
